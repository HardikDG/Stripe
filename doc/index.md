Stirpe is a payment infrastructure for the internet. Stripe Cordova SDK is built around the well organized REST API. it exposes a global `window.stripe` object that defines various operation to initialze and transfer payments.

Although the object is in the global scope, it is not available until after the `deviceready` event.

    document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
    function onDeviceReady() {
        console.log(window.stripe);
    }
